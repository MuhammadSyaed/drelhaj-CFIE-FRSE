More details can be found on http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/cfie/.\r\n\r\n# More about the tool:\r\n* Detects the structure of UK Annual Reports by detecting the key section, their start and end page and extracting the contents.\r\n* The tool provides A Section Classification mechanism to tell the type of the extracted section, each extracted section will be annotated with a number between 0 and 8 as follows:\r\n  * 1: Indicates a Chairman's Statement Section (this works with synonyms as well, e.g. Chairman's Letter)\r\n  * 2: CEO Review\r\n  * 3: Corporate Government Report\r\n  * 4: Directors Remuneration Report\r\n  * 5: Business Review\r\n  * 6: Financial Review\r\n  * 7: Operating Review\r\n  * 8: Highlights\r\n  * 0: Indicates any other section that doesn't belong to the sections between 1 and 8\r\n\r\n* The analysis results of the uploaded files or reports can be found in a subdirectory that follow the patter of \"FileName_Analysis\"\r\n  * For example if you are uploading a file called XYZCompany.pdf, the results will be in subdirectory called XYZCompany_Analysis\r\n* The tool provides more fields in the Sections_Frequencies.csv file which can be found in the Analysis sub-directory.\r\nThe new fields are:\r\n  * Start and End pages of each section\r\n  * Report Year, this will only work if the year was part of the file name. E.g. \"XYZCompany_2015.pdf\"\r\n  * Performance Flag: Shows 1 if a section is a performance section, 0 otherwise.\r\n  * Strategy Flag: Shows 1 if a section is a strategic section, 0 otherwise.\r\n  * Booklet Flag: Shows 1, 2 or 3 if a header is a booklet layout, 0 otherwise. Our tool is unable to process booklet annual reports (those reports where two pages are combined into one pdf page). Numbers 1-3 indicates how confident the system is. 1 suspects a booklet layout, 3 definitely a booklet layout\r\n  * The keyword lists (Forward Looking, Uncertainty, Positivity and Negativity) have been updated to eliminate duplicates and encoding errors.\r\n  * The matching process has been improved for a faster processing time.\r\n\r\nCFIE Team - cfie.project@gmail.com\r\n",
